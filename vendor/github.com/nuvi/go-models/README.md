# Go Models

The Go Models package holds the data structure for a social activity that is used throughout Monitors 2 and
all the payload structures as well. It has been extracted out of Social Activity Parser to simplify the imports in other applications and packages.
This package doesn't include external dependencies (except for go-logit).
